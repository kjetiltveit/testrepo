Digitalization made easy
Say goodbye to silos. Cetegra gives energy companies access to all applications and data in a unique, collaborative, and flexible cloud-based solution.

Flexible workspace
Whether it is about empowering your employees by enabling them to work from anywhere yet collaborating optimally, or supporting the usage of resource-intensive applications, Cetegra represents the ideal, tailor-made solution.

Leveraging the power of cloud computing and deployed as a full as-a-service offering, Cetegra simplifies work processes and increases productivity by providing an open application integration platform with an intuitive interface accessible to all users.

Effective cost management
Traditional IT procurement typically involves high capital expenditure, or significant up-front investments, to acquire critical IT assets. Public cloud solutions, on the other hand, rely on existing infrastructure from cloud vendors and thus eliminate capital expenditure through a pay-as-you-go model.

Cetegra allows you to use data centers provided by Cegal as well as major cloud vendors such as Microsoft Azure© or Amazon Web Services©.

The Cetegra subscription model enables you to keep all your operational costs under control. Additionally, the flexible tiering system can scale operational expenditure up and down as required.

Sustainability, wellbeing and safety
Cetegra helps you achieve your sustainability goals, as it is powered by low emissions and high-performance data centers.

You can also significantly reduce the high energy consumption levels, energy costs, and noise levels that are created by high-end workstations, servers, and even smaller computers.
